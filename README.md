# Vorpal: End-to-end Automated Testing Framework for Python
## Goals
Vorpal is an end-to-end automated testing framework designed to balance ease of development with performance and customizability.

## How to use Vorpal in a test project
### Requirements
* Python 3+

### First time setup
**Note:** The venv module has been included for the standard library in Python 3.3 and higher. 

**Side Note:** The pyvenv command is a wrapper around the venv module and some users have indicated we might want to consider avoiding the wrapper and just using the module directly.

From Python 3.3 to 3.4 the recommended way to create a virtual environment was to use the pyvenv command-line tool that also comes included with your Python 3 installation by default. But on 3.6 and above, python3 -m venv is the way to go.

1. Create a virtual environment named `env`
    * Command: `python3 -m venv env`
2. Activate the virtual environment
    * Command: `source env/bin/activate`
    * The following information obtained from: https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/
    ** Notice how your prompt is now prefixed with the name of your environment (env, in this case)
    ** This is the indicator that env is currently active, which means the python executable will only use this environmentâ€™s packages and settings.
3. Install the Vorpal framework via pip
    * Command: `pip3 install vorpal`
4. Install any other necessary dependencies for your project, like test runners (`pytest`, `nose`, etc.)
    * **Note:** You do _not_ need to separately install `selenium` since it is installed as a dependency of Vorpal
    
**Tip:** https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/ This site seems to contain some useful tips about maintaining multiple environments and using a tool called `virtualenvwrapper` to assist with this maintenance.

## Directions for Vorpal package owners/maintainers
### How to upload a new package version
As we build new features for Vorpal we will want to make them available on pypi.python.org. To do this, we must complete the following steps:

1. Update the `version` argument in `setup.py`
    * We use semantic versioning, so please follow [semantic versioning guidelines]:
        * Bug fixes and minor changes increment the third digit (`1.0.0 => 1.0.1`)
        * New features that don't break existing functionality increment the second digit (`1.0.0 => 1.1.0`)
        * Changes that break backward compatibility increment the first digit (`1.0.0 => 2.0.0`)
2. Build a `wheel`
    * Vorpal is built exclusively for Python3, so we want to build a ['pure' Python wheel]
    * To build a wheel, we need to install the `wheel` package, so run `pip install wheel` if you haven't already
    * We build the wheel by running `python setup.py bdist_wheel` from the project root
3. Upload to PyPI
    * Install `twine` via `pip install twine` if you haven't already
    * Run `twine upload dist/*` in the project root and enter your PyPI username and password when prompted
